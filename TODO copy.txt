# TODO: Atomized Evaluation Script Calls for All Datasets

# This file lists every individual shell script call that would be made if we were to run
# evaluate_control_library.sh, evaluate_rounding.sh, and evaluate_tailored_library.sh
# for every dataset in the Experiments codebase. Each call is written as it would appear
# in a shell script, with explicit arguments.

# Example noise level (adjust as needed)
