list of experiments to perform
Handling ground truth data for all models


Leading Ones & OneMax data
- Exploring model performance after the given maximum porfolio
- Exploring model performance on unseen instance sizes within the model bounds.
- Jumble data so it is not in order and looks similar to what would be expected from a model.
- Can these models learn the equation on a single instance if not given the instance size (i.e. Can they learn the hyperparameter)

- Varying threshold value for DeepSR for DeepRL model performance within noisy data

- With continuous data + rounding
- With data after rounding

PSA-CMA-ES
- Exploring ground truth ability to learn model when given the Alpha and Beta Values
- Exploring noisy ability to learn model when given the Alpha and Beta Values
- Exploring ground truth ability to learn model when not given the Alpha and Beta Values
- Exploring noisy ability to learn model when not given the Alpha and Beta ValueseepRL

- With continuous data + rounding
- With data after rounding

- Varying threshold value for DeepSR for DeepRL model performance within noisy data

- Using porfolio and DDQN network vs using PPO 

- Building a DeepRL KAN

- Using DSO for optimisations for CMA-ES hyperparameters

Notes:
Added rounding to DeepSR. It works, but it can't use rounding with respect to polyfit and inversions
